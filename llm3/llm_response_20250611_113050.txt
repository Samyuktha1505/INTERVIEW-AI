    "Degree and Major": "Not available in the transcript",
    "Year of Graduation": "Not available in the transcript",
    "CGPA / Percentage / Grade Format": "Not available in the transcript",
    "List of all Courses or Subjects and corresponding Grades/Scores": "Not available in the transcript. The transcript contains case study questions related to Forestry, Shopping Cart, Search Functionality, and Legacy System Migration.",
    "Any Academic Honors or Distinctions": "Not available in the transcript",
    "Observations about academic trends": "Cannot determine trends as specific grades or scores are not present. The student references projects like 'Forestry' and 'Shopping Cart' which suggests prior coursework or projects.",
    "Strength areas": "Based on the Assistant's initial response to the questions, the student seemingly has experience and knowledge across web development (React, Angular, Vue.js), database management (MySQL, sharding, replication), search algorithms (Elasticsearch, Apache Lucene, fuzzy matching), and system migration strategies.",
    "Weak areas": "It is impossible to define the weak areas of the student based on the provided transcript since it does not include grades or scores. Based on the interaction the student showed some confusion regarding the interview process and their role"
  },
  "Metrics": {
    "Case Study Performance Assessment": {
      "Sustainability Website Design": "The response demonstrates understanding of modern web frameworks, scalability, user experience principles, and API integration for data retrieval. The mention of headless CMS and specific libraries like Chart.js indicates practical knowledge.",
      "Database Performance Optimization": "The answer includes standard database diagnosis techniques (monitoring, query analysis, locking detection) and optimization strategies (indexing, query rewriting, connection pooling, caching, scaling). The breadth of solutions, including both vertical and horizontal scaling, is noteworthy.",
      "Search Functionality Improvement": "The response covers key areas of search system development, including indexing, query processing (fuzzy matching, multiple filters, autocomplete, synonym handling), and ranking algorithms (TF-IDF, BM25, machine learning). Consideration of relevance feedback and personalization is a plus.",
      "Legacy System Migration": "Only the start of the response is present, so the full response can't be assessed."
